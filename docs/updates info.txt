Jim Johnson - Director of Operations (at the top) - you can drop CityLight because this is a CityLight website so everyone listed will be CLCS team members, and if net we can notate.
Robert Matlock - Trades Manager (directly below me)
Clayton Wadlington - Electrical Field Manager (pictured side by side with other field managers below Robert Matlock)
James Pridmore - Carpentry/Roofing Field Manager (pictured side by side with other field managers below Robert Matlock)
Edward Reed - HVAC Field Manager (pictured side by side with other field managers below Robert Matlock)

Jerome Watkins - Plumbing/HVAC Technician
